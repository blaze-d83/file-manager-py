# Terminal File Manager (Python)

## Overview
This terminal file manager is designed to provide a lightweight yet functional interface for navigating and managing files and directories directly from the command line. Inspired by Vim keybindings, it offers intuitive controls (j, k, l, h) for navigation and basic file operations (cp <source> <destination>).

## Features

### Directory Navigation:
Move in (l) and out (h) through directories.

### File Listing:
View files and directories in the current directory.

### Cursor Navigation:
Use j and k to navigate through the list.

### File Operations:
Copy files using cp <source> <destination>.


## Installation

### Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaze-d83/file-manager-py
cd terminal-file-manager-python
Running the File Manager
```

### Run the Python script:

```bash
python file_manager.py
```

## Navigating and Operating

Use j and k to move the cursor up and down the file list.
Use l to enter a directory (navigate into the selected directory).
Use h to go up one directory level (navigate back).
Use cp <source> <destination> to copy files.
Type exit to quit the file manager.
